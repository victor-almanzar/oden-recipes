  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    What Is Mofongo?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Mofongo de Chicharrón</strong> is a classic Caribbean dish primarily made of mashed fried green plantains,
    blended with crispy pork cracklings (chicharrón). This combination gives the dish its distinctive
    rich, meaty flavor. Enhanced with aromatic garlic, a dash of olive oil or butter, and salt,
    the mixture is traditionally shaped using a "pilón" (mortar and pestle). The result is a
    dense, savory treat often paired with broth or other proteins, celebrating the transformative
    power of simple ingredients.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Green plantains: These are the base of the dish. The plantains are peeled,
      sliced, and then fried until they are golden.
    </li>
    <li>
      Garlic: Crushed garlic gives mofongo its signature flavor. The garlic is
      often made into a paste and mixed into the dish.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pork cracklings (chicharrón): These are crushed and mixed with the mashed
      plantains. Some versions of mofongo use bacon or other forms of pork.
    </li>
    <li>
      Olive oil or butter: This is used to sauté the garlic and also to add
      moisture and richness to the mashed plantains.
    </li>
    <li>
      Salt: To taste.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The green plantains are peeled, sliced, and fried.
    </li>

      or butter.
    </li>
    <li>
      The mixture is molded into individual servings, typically with a cup or the pilón itself.
    </li>
