This is a basic HTML project about recipes from my parents home country of the Dominican Republic.


## Concluding Notes

This project served as a valuable experience for several reasons:

1. **Greasing the Grooves with HTML & CSS:** After a hiatus from creating web pages, this project allowed me to revisit and refresh my skills in HTML and CSS.

2. **Introduction to GitHub Pages:** This was a beneficial dive into understanding how GitHub Pages works and the nuances of deploying static sites.
